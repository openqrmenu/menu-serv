 * the password by hashing the password supplied by the user and comparing it to
 * the hashed password stored in the database.  If the comparison succeeds, the
 * user is authenticated; otherwise, not.

 * by verifying the session.  The same user information that was serialized at
 * session establishment will be restored when the session is authenticated by
 * the `deserializeUser` function.

 * fetch todo records and render the user element in the navigation bar, that
 * information is stored in the session.
