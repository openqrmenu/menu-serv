/** POST /login/password
 *
 * This route authenticates the user by verifying a username and password.
 *
 * A username and password are submitted to this route via an HTML form, which
 * was rendered by the `GET /login` route.  The username and password is
 * authenticated using the `local` strategy.  The strategy will parse the
 * username and password from the request and call the `verify` function.
 *
 * Upon successful authentication, a login session will be established.  As the
 * user interacts with the app, by clicking links and submitting forms, the
 * subsequent requests will be authenticated by verifying the session.
 *
 * When authentication fails, the user will be re-prompted to login and shown
 * a message informing them of what went wrong.
